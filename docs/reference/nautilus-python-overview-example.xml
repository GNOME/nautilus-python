    <title>A Simple Extension</title>

    <para>Create an empty file with the following code:</para>
    
    <example>
        <title>A Simple Extension</title>
        <programlisting><xi:include href="../../examples/TestExtension.py" parse="text" /></programlisting>
    </example>
    
    <para>Save this file as TestExtension.py in the ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions folder. 
    You may need to create this folder. To run, simply restart Nautilus.</para>

    <para>Once Nautilus restarts, right-click on a file and you should see a new menu item, 
    "Showing #filename#". It is as simple as that!</para>
    
    <para>As mentioned above, in order to 
    get loaded by Nautilus, a python extension must import the Nautilus module from gi.repository, 
    create a class derived from a nautilus *Provider and a gobject.GObject, and create the methods that 
    will be called by Nautilus when it requests information from its providers. 
    In this case, when someone right-clicks on a file, Nautilus will ask all of its 
    MenuProviders for additional menu items to show the user. When folders or files are clicked, 
    the get_file_items method is called and a list of Nautilus.MenuItems is expected.</para>
