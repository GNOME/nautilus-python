1.1:
    - Added pygobject3 compatibility.  Retained pygobject 2.28.x compatibility.
        Updated extension examples to support pygobject3.
    - Fixed bug #660290. Updated the FSF address
    - Fixed bug #660288. Fix autogen warnings with additional macro ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS
    - Fixed bug #660287. Make the docdir not hard-coded
    - Fixed bug #660286. Fixes m4 underquoting warning
    - Fixed bug #660283. Fixes html docs installation issue
    - Fixed bug #653169. Upated the COPYING file with the most recent GPLv2 license

1.0.0:
    - Use the gobject instrospection dynamic bindings, breaks compatibility
        for existing extensions.
    - For Nautilus3, the get_toolbar_items methods have been removed. (Only reporting
        that change, it isn't up to us).  Should still work with Nautilus 2.x annotations.
    - No longer look in the old ~/.nautilus/python-extensions or /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions2.0/python
        folders for extensions.  Now look in ~/.local/share/nautilus-python/extensions or
        $XDG_DATA_DIR/nautilus-python/extensions.  Extensions should be arch-independent now.
    - General clean up of the repository, removed old .cvsignore files
    - Updated the gtk-doc documentation and examples to work with new dynamic bindings.

0.7.2:
    - Fix to get the PyCapsule patch to work even if there is no PyCapsule 
        object set up for pygtk.

0.7.1:
    - Fixed AM_CHECK_PYTHON_LIBS usage of test (GNOME bug #619440)
    - Cleaned up the docs Makefile.am to make it more consistent
    - Fix some python3 syntax issues in the python.m4 script
    - Add python 2.7 support (GNOME bug #633171)

0.7.0:
    - Added methods:
        nautilus.InfoProvider.update_file_info_full
        nautilus.InfoProvider.update_complete_invoke
        nautilus.InfoProvider.cancel_update
        nautilus.MenuProvider.get_file_items_full
        nautilus.MenuProvider.get_background_items_full
        nautilus.MenuProvider.get_toolbar_items_full
        nautilus.MenuProvider.emit_items_updated_signal
    - Added complete gtk-doc documentation: tutorial and reference.  Enable
        by adding the --enable-gtk-doc argument to ./configure or ./autogen.sh
    - Updated the autogen.sh file so it is not a copied-over obsolete version
        of gnome-autogen.sh, but a shell that calls the user's installed
        gnome-autogen.sh.
    - Removed obsolete .spec file
    - Removed obsolete examples/documentation.py file
    - Added an example plugin for the LocationWidgetProvider
    - Look for python plugins in $XDG_DATA_DIR/nautilus-python/extensions.  This
        includes ~/.local/share and /usr/share (or whatever $XDG_DATA_DIR is set
        to)

0.6.1:
    - Look for libpython2.6.so.1.0 instead of libpython2.6.so, the latter 
	is general available from -devel packages only.
    - Re-added the missing spec and pc files
    - Free pygobject data directly after using file objects.  Stops seg 
	faults from occurring when nautilus wants to free pygobject data
	after Py_Finalize() is called.

    - Sanitize python search path (Mark Lee)

    - Added the can_write, get_mount, get_file_type, get_location, 
        and get_parent_location methods to the NautilusFileInfo object
    - Added the NautilusMenu.get_items method
    - Updated some example plugins
    - Bug fix for some PyThreadState_New segmentation faults
    - Use the nautilus prefix by default for distfiles, rather than /usr
    - Require nautilus-2.22 and pygobject-2.16 now that we support GIO
